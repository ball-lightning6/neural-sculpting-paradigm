- generate_arc_column_projection.py: Tests the model's ability to recognize complex contextual relationships ("below..." and "within the range of...") and perform conditional column operations.
    
- generate_arc_procedural_spiral.py: Tests the model's ability to execute an iterative, procedural generation algorithm. The model needs to understand instructions, track state (current position, direction, length), and execute in a loop.
    
- generate_arc_fractal_stamping.py: Tests the model's ability to understand and execute recursive or fractal generation rules. The model needs to use the input pattern itself as a "brush" and repeatedly draw it according to "instructions" within the input pattern.
    
- generate_arc_flood_fill.py: Tests the model's ability to execute the classic "Flood Fill" or "Paint Bucket" algorithm.
    
- generate_arc_layered_fill.py: Tests the model's ability to understand a highly procedural and complex filling algorithm that depends on topological distance and conditional logic.

- generate_arc_fill_square_holes.py: Tests the model's ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning: first, identify "holes," then determine their geometric properties (whether they are squares), and finally, act based on that determination.
    
- generate_arc_conditional_recoloring.py: Tests the model's ability to understand visual layers and perform conditional modification of object properties.
    
- generate_arc_sort_by_length_remap_position.py: Tests the model's ability to perform a complex sorting task involving "attribute-position decoupling and remapping."

- generate_arc_jigsaw_puzzle_advanced.py: Tests the model's ability to solve a complex visual matching and transformation problem. This version requires the model to genuinely match based on shape, not just size.
    
- generate_arc_connect_path_by_sequence.py: Tests the model's ability to parse an external sequence of instructions and execute a multi-step, stateful path connection task within an image accordingly.
    
- generate_arc_reflection_simulation_deprecated.py: Aimed to test the model's understanding of complex physics-based optics rules, including ray emission, collision detection, angle reflection, and color transformation. (Deprecated)
    

## H. Inverse Rule Inference

- generate_cellular_automata_inverse_rule.py: This experiment is the first attempt to test the model's **Inverse Reasoning** ability. The question is: if the model can forward-propagate from a rule to a result, can it reverse-engineer the underlying rule from "input-output" pairs?
    
- generate_cellular_automata_inverse_rule_and_steps.py: This is an earlier version before the "unique solution" version was implemented. It also aimed to have the model learn to predict the rule and the number of iterations.
    
- generate_cellular_automata_inverse_rule_and_steps_unique.py: This is a major upgrade to the inverse reasoning task. I not only require the model to infer **what** rule was applied, but also **how many times** it was applied.
    

## I. Robustness Analysis

- generate_cellular_automata_1d_perturbed.py: This script aims to systematically test the robustness of the "neural carving" paradigm when faced with imperfect data. By introducing controllable random perturbations to the input (simulating observation noise) and the output (simulating label noise), it explores the continuous spectrum of model performance transitioning from an ideal rule-based world to a noisy real world.
